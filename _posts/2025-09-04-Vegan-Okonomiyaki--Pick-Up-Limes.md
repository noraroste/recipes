## Vegan Okonomiyaki  Pick Up Limes

Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) is a Japanese savoury pancake. Variations of this dish can be found throughout Japan, but the base is usually a wheat batter, which coats fillings like cabbage, seafood, meat, grated yam, or even noodles. We were inspired to make a vegan version which uses king trumpet mushrooms for a "meaty" texture and a kombu-infused broth for a taste of the sea.
