## Kimchi Sundubu-jjigae (Spicy Soft Tofu Stew)

It's about time for some sizzling, comforting stew, isn't it? How about sundubu-jjigae? It's hot, spicy, filling, comforting, delicious, soft tofu stew and has many reasons to love!

> **Note:** The original recipe includes pork belly, but you can easily make a vegetarian version by omitting the pork and using vegetable stock instead of anchovy stock. Mushrooms make an excellent substitute for a savory, umami-rich flavor.
